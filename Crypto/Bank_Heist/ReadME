Bank_Heist.zip is the challenge here. It's password is "hackthebox". [without double quotes].

Walkthrough.zip is the walkthrough. As of now, the challenge is still active. Its a good old tradition of not sharing the walkthroughs when the challenge is still active. Hence this is password protected. If you have already solved the challenge and want to view the walkthrough, then the password is the flag itself.

It is forbidden to remove the password and distribute the files of active challenges. If someone does so, I take no responsibility. 
Happy Hacking :)
